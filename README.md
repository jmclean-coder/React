- two way binding, aka, a controlled component.
- Data down, action up (via callbacks!)
- Intro to filter
- shorter filtering, looks pretty, but is it nicer?
- removed short filter because who does that anyways?
- prefer most common filter for this use case
- Started parts on conditional rendering,
    - I already knew the ternary way
    - I already knew the "true && render this next thing" way
        - I find it weird to split the check into two completly seperate checks, but could be nice as a pre-refactor step

- Well thats new, I hadn't thought of using a let variable to store the default JSX (0 expenses from filter)
    - Then we use a conditional to determine if we update that variable with the result of out filter data
